Memory-MHP
==========

A card game for MHP systems

This application was created to show the use of some simple parts of MHP. It only has educational purposes. It's easy to understand how it works. I was the first [MHP app](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Home_Platform) I created when I started to work at university.

I upload it due to its (personal) "historical interest" :)


THE GAME
--------

The game is based on find pairs of cards. You have three pre-established times and difficult levels to find every pair. There are many things to fix, but the basics parts of it works. Colored buttons are used for navigation.


EXECUTING THE GAME
------------------

To use the game you will need a STB that support MHP or some DVB-MHP emulator as the SDKs from Osmosys or Alticast or the free (but not finished) [XletView emulator](http://www.xletview.org/)
